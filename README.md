# GeneAccord #

This R package has functions to detect clonal exclusivity or co-occurrence patterns of altered genes or pathways in a cohort of cancer patients. Such clonally exclusive gene pairs may uncover synergies between co-existing clones.

The file geneAccord_AML.R reads in the data from the AML cohort and runs the three different GeneAccord tests on the data.
